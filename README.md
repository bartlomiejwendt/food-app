# Simple Food delivery app
Hello, I am currently making some projects to fill my portfolio and learn new things. I wanted to build food app but I had no ideas how it should look etc.
Homepage design is not mine I found it in the internet and I do not know who the real author is.

## [General info](#general)
I made this app in about 4 days. I used Ant Design - React UI framework, React and Typescript to create this app. <br />
There was version of this app with working Dashboard for users that add company. <br />
They could add products from dashboard and receive user orders and then accept or reject them. <br />
A few people reviewing this app told me that this functionality was useless so I decided that I should remove it so I did. <br />
I write this for users that have seen this app in previous version and are curious why dashboard is not working now.

## [Technologies](#technologies)
To create this app I used React, TypeScript, SCSS, Ant Design and Firebase

## [Setup](#setup)
If you want to run this on your computer: <br />

**This app will not work locally because of environment variables required to connect to Firebase**

1. Clone this repository
2. type **npm install** in app directory.
3. type **npm start** in app directory.
4. head to http://localhost:3000/
5. Enjoy!
